Vietnamese math task is a simple task where we have to find solution for equation. 
We have to put different figures from 1-9 into each blank field.
You can see table fields in vietnamese-math-task.jpg file.
There is main one rule: You can use every figure only once! 
So if you input 9 in one field you cannot put nine into other field in the same iteration.

Solution code and output is in vietnamese_math_task.py file.
