 Tom is a salesman. He has a goal of selling T total units over the span of next D days. 
 Because of some restrictions from his supplier he can only sell at most d(i) items in a day. 
 Fortunately for him, his supplier has provided him a list of the maximum number of items he can sell each day for the D days in advance. 
 Can you help him to identify in how many different ways can he sell his product over the span of D days,
